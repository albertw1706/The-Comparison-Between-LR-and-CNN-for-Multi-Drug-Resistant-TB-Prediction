# The Comparison Between LR and CNN for Multi-Drug Resistant TB Prediction


Reproduced a Convolutional Neural Network model with an architecture from Green et al. (2022) and also created a Logistic Regression model to predict drug resistance in multi-drug resistant TB. 

-----------------

The input for the CNN was a 4D tensor of one-hot encoded selected genes extracted from MSA files obtained from Green et al. (2022), while the input for LR was VCF files from preprocessed FASTQ files.
